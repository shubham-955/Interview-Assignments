Q-2. Why do we use pseudo-class?
Ans = 
1. A pseudo-class is used to define a special state of an element. 
2. For example, it can be used to: Style an element when a user mouses over it. Style visited and unvisited links 
   differently.

Q-3. How is specificity applied?
Ans = 
1. Specificity determines which CSS rule is applied to a specific HTML element at any moment in browsers.
2. Specificity is a type of weighting that has a bearing on how your cascading style sheet (CSS) rules are 
   displayed.    
3. Every single selector has its own specificity, and if two selectors apply to the same element, the one with 
   higher specificity wins.   

Q-4. What method allows an element to be moved from its current position?   
Ans =
1. The translate() method moves an element from its current position 
   (according to the parameters given for the X-axis and the Y-axis).

Q-6. What is the difference between flex and grids?   
Ans = 
1. Grid is made for two-dimensional layout while flex is for one. 
2. This means flex can work on either row or columns at a time, but Grids can work on both. 
3. Flex gives you more flexibility while working on either element (row or column).

Q-7. Give an example where we have to use grids and where you have to use flexbox?
Ans = 
1. Grid - Grid allows you to create two-dimensional layouts where you can precisely place grid items into cells 
          defined by rows and columns.
2. Flexbox - Flexbox is ideal when you have a small layout design to implement, with a few rows or a few columns. 
             You need to align elements           

Q-8. Give an example where you cannot use flexbox, and you can only use grids?
Ans = Don't use flexbox for page layout. A basic grid system using percentages, max-widths, and media queries is 
      a much safer approach for creating responsive page layouts.               

Q-9. What are combinators? give examples of how you can use them
Ans = 
1. CSS combinators are explaining the relationship between two selectors. 
2. CSS selectors are the patterns used to select the elements for style purpose. 
3. A CSS selector can be a simple selector or a complex selector consisting of more than one selector connected 
   using combinators.

Q-10. What does object-fit do?
Ans = 
1. The object-fit CSS property sets how the content of a replaced element, such as an <img> or <video> , 
   should be resized to fit its container. 
2. You can alter the alignment of the replaced element's content object within the element's box using the 
   object-position property.

Ans = The rotate() CSS function defines a transformation that rotates an element around a fixed point on the 2D 
      plane, without deforming it.

Q-12. What rule can be used to define animations?
Ans = 
1. The @keyframes rule specifies the animation code. 
2. The animation is created by gradually changing from one set of CSS styles to another.       

Q-13. When working with attribute selectors, how can you select elements which contain a particular attribute value?
Ans = You can use the *= operator to make an attribute selector matches all elements whose attribute value 
      contains a specified value.

Q-14. What does @media do?
Ans = 
1. The @media rule is used in media queries to apply different styles for different media types/devices.
2. Media queries can be used to check many things, such as:
   A. width and height of the viewport
   B. width and height of the device
   C. orientation (is the tablet/phone in landscape or portrait mode?)
   D. resolution

Q-15. What can be used to override properties of an element?
Ans =
1. How to override !important.

   the existing one.

Q-16. How can you select every alternate elements in a list of elements using css?

Q-17. What is the ranking of selectors with respect to specificity
Ans = 
1. Every selector has its place in the specificity hierarchy. 
2. If two selectors apply to the same element, the one with higher specificity wins. 
3. There are four distinct categories which define the specificity level of a given selector: 
   A. inline styles 
   B. IDs, classes 
   C. attributes 
   D. elements.

Q-18. how can we apply same styles to multiple selectors?
Ans = 
1. When you group CSS selectors, you apply the same styles to several different elements without repeating the 
   styles in your stylesheet. 
2. Instead of having two, three, or more CSS rules that do the same thing (set the color of something to red, 
   for example), you use a single CSS rule that accomplishes the same thing.

Q-19. What are the differences between relative and absolute in CSS?
Ans = 
1. position: relative places an element relative to its current position without changing the layout around it. 
2. position: absolute places an element relative to its parent's position and changing the layout around it.
