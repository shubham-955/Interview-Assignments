Q-1. Create a function called toggler using closures?
Ans = The answer for this question is in Toggler folder

Q-2. What are IIFE?
Ans = 
1. An Immediately-invoked Function Expression (IIFE for friends) is a way to execute functions immediately, 
   as soon as they are created. 
2. IIFEs are very useful because they don't pollute the global object, and they are a simple way to isolate 
   variables declarations.

Q-3. What is currying?
Ans = 
1. Currying is a technique of evaluating function with multiple arguments, into sequence of functions with single 
   argument.
2. In other words, when a function, instead of taking all arguments at one time, takes the first one and return a 
   new function that takes the second one and returns a new function which takes the third one, and so forth, 
   until all arguments have been fulfilled.
3. Uses of currying function
   A. It helps to avoid passing same variable again and again.
   B. It is extremely useful in event handling. 
4. For eg.
        function Myfunction(a) {
            return (b) => {
                return (c) => {
                    return a * b * c
                }
            }
        }

        Myfunction(1, 2, 3); // 6

Q-4. Write a program to throttle using closures?
Ans = The answer for this question is in Throttling folder.

Q-5. Explain some areas where you have seen currying being implemented in React / other libraries?
Ans = 
1. There are cases when we want to pass additional data to a React event handler.
2. For eg. 
    const List = ({items}) => {
        const handleClick = () => {
            console.log("How do I get the item related to the button?");
        };
        return (
            <ul>
                {items.map((item) => (
                    <li key={item}>
                    <span>{item}</span>
                    <button onClick={handleClick}>
                    Log
                    </button>
                    </li>
                ))}
            </ul>
        );
    };
3. In the above example, We are passing the list item data to handleClick, this is nothing but currying.
